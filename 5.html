How to Remove Junk Food From Your Diet Low Carb Lunch for Someone With High Blood Sugar What Foods are Good to Eat for Breakfast on Weight Watchers? <p> Losing weight requires burning more calories than you consume. You can do this by exercising more and eating less. While this sounds simple enough, dropping unwanted pounds isn't always easy. Making lifestyle choices that support weight loss a part of your daily routine helps you stick with it until you reach your goal. Talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise or diet plan.</p> <h2> Morning</h2> <p> Eating breakfast plays a role in weight loss. Skipping your morning meal means you'll be so hungry later that you're more likely to overdo it. Make breakfast a part of your daily routine, but don't go overboard on calories. Oatmeal with a handful of chopped nuts and skim milk or Greek yogurt with chopped fruit and a sprinkle of granola make good choices. Fill your water bottle and carry it with you all day. This can help stop you from reaching for high-calorie snacks during the day, according to Weight Watchers. Clip on a pedometer, which can help you monitor how much you're moving during the day. More movement translates to a bigger calorie burn.</p> <h2> Noon</h2> <p> You might be tempted to grab dinner at the local drive-through, whether you're at the office or running errands. This can derail your weight-loss goals because restaurant meals are often loaded with salt, sugar, fat and calories. Pack your own lunch from home to control calorie intake and keep your midday meal healthy, suggests Weight Watchers. When you're out and about, fit in more activity by taking the stairs at work or the mall instead of the elevator and park a few rows away from the door at your office or the store so you can fit in some extra steps. Stash healthy snacks in your desk or purse, such as nuts and string cheese, so you aren't tempted by high-calorie snacks when mid-afternoon hunger strikes.</p> <h2> Night</h2> <p> If you pick up take-out or heat up a microwave dinner because you're tired, you could be hindering your weight-loss goals. Prepare a large batch of several healthy meals on the weekend and portion them out so you have an easy and nutritious meal at the end of a long day. Swap out cooking fats for herbs and spices to ramp up flavor while cutting calories, suggests Weight Watchers. Keep unhealthy snacks out of the house if you tend to nibble while you watch television. Instead, have air-popped popcorn, which is low in calories, but high in fiber to satisfy your hunger. Go to bed early enough to get at least seven hours of sleep. Lack of sleep increases hunger hormones and reduces your motivation to stick to your healthy daytime routine.</p> <h2> Adding Exercise</h2> <p> Exercise is a vital part of any weight-loss plan and it helps prevent many health conditions, including obesity and heart disease. There isn't a magical time to add exercise to your daily routine, but making it a habit ensures you'll stick with it. If going for a run or hitting the pool first thing in the morning is easiest for you, add your workout as soon as you get out of bed. If the end of the day is more convenient, head to the gym after work or pop in a workout DVD while dinner cooks. If you can't manage to find time for exercise in the morning or the evening, take a walk during your lunch break or join a yoga group that meets in the park at lunchtime.</p> <span> </span> <span> </span> <h4> References</h4> Health: 16 Ways to Lose Weight Fast Weight Watchers: 25 Little Tips for Big Weight Loss Help Guide: How to Lose Weight and Keep It Off Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Losing Weight Reader's Digest: Easy Ways to Lose Weight: 50+ Ideas Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: How Much Physical Activity Do Adults Need? <span> </span> <span> </span> <h4> Photo Credits</h4> Hemera Technologies/PhotoObjects.net/Getty Images <span> </span> <span> </span> <h4> About the Author</h4> <p> Eliza Martinez has written for print and online publications.
