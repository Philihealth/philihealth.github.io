Whether it’s a little or a lot, losing weight and keeping it off is no easy task.</p> <h2> Why are motivational weight loss quotes so important to our success?</h2> <p> Our thoughts are powerful. What we tell ourselves matters. </p> <p> When <strong> we’re happier with a positive mindset</strong> , we tend to <strong> make healthier decisions</strong> , including those that lead to <strong> weight loss</strong> —such as saying no to junk food, getting enough sleep, moving more, taking care of your body and eating healthy.</p> <h3> Related: Get Happy Lose Weight; The Mind-Body Link That Matters </h3> <p> Unfortunately that voice in our head that says &#8220;give up&#8221; is usually louder than the one that says &#8220;keep going.&#8221; So the next time you&#8217;re feeling discouraged, read one of these encouraging, inspirational, motivational quotes to yourself to lift your mood. </p> <p> </p> <h2> How can I get myself motivated to lose weight?</h2> <p> Losing weight and keeping it off isn&#8217;t easy. But neither is being overweight and out of shape. </p> <p> As far as I&#8217;m concerned working to be in good health, in good spirits and able to fit into my clothes is WORTH the effort. After years of struggle I feel like I&#8217;ve finally unlocked the secret to lasting weight loss success:</p> <p> <strong> Find your why.</strong> Have a strong reason for wanting to lose weight. For me it&#8217;s all about being healthy, happy, and wanting to grow old gracefully and vibrantly. I want to be able to feel good so I can continue to travel and pursue my dreams. </p> <p> <strong> Do it your way.</strong> It&#8217;s important to lose weight your way , not someone else&#8217;s. You need to find changes that you are willing to make forever, not jus for a day or a week or until you&#8217;ve reached your goal. </p> <p> <strong> Focus on teeny tiny changes.</strong> It&#8217;s much better to commit to a little change that you can actually accomplish regularly than a huge one that you are never able to get done. Years ago one of my favorite yogas told me to &#8220;only do as much yoga as feels good&#8221; because &#8220;a little yoga done often is better than a lot of yoga done rarely.&#8221; Turns out this is the secret to any lasting behavior change. </p> <p> <strong> Celebrate you successes .</strong> We are hardwired to do what makes us feel good. Find healthy ways to celebrate when you accomplish your new habits, hit your targets and achieve your goals, regardless of how small they seem. This positive feeling can help propel you forward.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <h2> What have good health quotes got to do with it?</h2> <p> Reading and collecting motivational and inspirational quotes including ones for good health is one of my favorite strategies for filling my mind with the <strong> positive thinking </strong> that can lead to increased health and happiness. I&#8217;ve gathered many of my favorites here in hopes they benefit you too. </p> <h3> Here are 10 of My Favorites About Good Health:</h3> &#8220;Happiness is the highest form of health.&#8221; ~ Dalai Lama &#8220;The greatest wealth is health.&#8221; ~ Virgil &#8220;Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.&#8221; ~ Hippocrates &#8220;I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you.&#8221; ~ Joyce Meyer &#8220;Moderation.

There are even people who smoke one or two cigarettes a week.

How long do you keep eating? You just do it.&#8221;</p> <p> 2) &#8220;Everything you do in life, I don&#8217;t care, good or bad – don&#8217;t blame God, don&#8217;t blame the devil, don&#8217;t blame me, blame you. You control everything! The thoughts you think, the words you utter, the foods you eat, the exercise you do. Everything is controlled by you.&#8221;</p> <p> 3) &#8220;How do you build up your bank account? By putting something in it everyday. Your health account is no different. What I do today, I am wearing tomorrow. If I put inferior foods in my body today, I&#8217;m going to be inferior tomorrow, it&#8217;s that simple.&#8221;</p> <p> 4) &#8220;The only way you get that fat off is to eat less and exercise more.&#8221;</p> <p> 5) &#8220;There are so many health food nuts out there that eat nothing but natural foods but they don&#8217;t exercise and they look terrible.&#8221;</p> <p> 6) &#8220;We know today about nutrition and we know about exercise. There&#8217;s no reason for anybody to be sick and tired, fat and out of shape it&#8217;s ridiculous! This has got to be taught in the schools. It&#8217;s got to be taught in kindergarten. That&#8217;s when kids should first get the idea that the most important thing in your life is your health and your body.&#8221;</p> <p> 7) &#8220;Virtually everything we do in life is a matter of habit. Habits make us who we are. Why not change your habits to better your life?&#8221;</p> <p> 8) &#8220;You need to make good health a hobby.&#8221;</p> <p> 9) &#8220;Physical fitness takes commitment to exercise just as it requires good nutrition. But it doesn&#8217;t have to be painful. Just the opposite: Vigorous exercise actually is stimulating. It boosts your energy levels, invigorates your mind, and just feels good afterward. The hardest part, of course, is getting started.&#8221;</p> <p> 10) &#8220;Go on, have a glass of wine with dinner. What is wine, anyway? Pure grapes. A glass of wine is much better for you than a Coke.&#8221;</p> <p> </p> <h2> More Motivational Quotes from My Ever-growing Collection</h2> <p> &#8220;If the only prayer you said was thank you, that would be enough.&#8221; Meister Eckhart</p> <p> &#8220;Behind all this, some great happiness is hiding.&#8221; — Yehuda Amichai</p> <p> &#8220;Happiness depends upon ourselves.&#8221; — Aristotle</p> <p> &#8220;Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.&#8221; — Mahatma Gandhi</p> <p> &#8220;The only joy in the world is to begin.&#8221; — Cesare Pavese</p> <p> &#8220;It is only possible to live happily ever after on a daily basis.&#8221; — Margaret Bonanno</p> <p> &#8220;The pleasure which we most rarely experience gives us greatest delight.&#8221; — Epictetus</p> <p> &#8220;Remember this, that very little is needed to make a happy life.&#8221; — Marcus Aurelius</p> <p> &#8220;I wake up every morning with a great desire to live joyfully.&#8221; — Anna Howard Shaw</p> <p> &#8220;Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you have was once among the things you only hoped for.&#8221; Epicurus</p> <p> &#8220;Not what we have But what we enjoy, constitutes our abundance.&#8221; Epicurus</p> <p> &#8220;Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom.&#8221; Marcel Proust</p> <p> &#8220;Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all others.&#8221; Marcus Tullius Cicero</p> <p> &#8220;Cultivate the habit of being grateful for every good thing that comes to you, and to give thanks continuously.
