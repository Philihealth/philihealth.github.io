Effective fat loss workouts are generally energy depleting and physically and mentally taxing and best paired with a nutritional plan of attack that’s filled with healthy, whole foods (no processed, fast food crap), which leaves you in a slight calorie deficit to lose weight.</span> </p> <p> Enter the 6-Week Fat Loss Workout Program.</p> <p> To maximally reduce your body fat percent , you’re going to have to start in the kitchen. You may have heard the saying that  abs are made in the kitchen , which is true – you can lose fat and not even pick up a single weight or run a single step through caloric deficit. But in order to lose weight, build muscle, increase muscular strength, and improve your cardio fitness you’re going to have to start putting some effort into your weight loss goals . So, to lose fat as much as possible, your program will consist of 3 full body workouts per week (alternating between Workout A and Workout B) with 2 days of cardio and 2 days off.</p> <p> Over the 6-weeks, your fat loss workout program will look like this:</p> <p> <span> <strong> Week</strong> </span> </p> <p> <span> <strong> Sunday</strong> </span> </p> <p> <span> <strong> Monday</strong> </span> </p> <p> <span> <strong> Tuesday</strong> </span> </p> <p> <span> <strong> Wednesday</strong> </span> </p> <p> <span> <strong> Thursday</strong> </span> </p> <p> <span> <strong> Friday</strong> </span> </p> <p> <span> <strong> Saturday</strong> </span> </p> <p> <strong> 1</strong> </p> <p> Rest</p> <p> Full body<br> Workout A</p> <p> Cardio<br> Workout 1</p> <p> Full body<br> Workout B</p> <p> Rest</p> <p> Full body<br> Workout A</p> <p> Cardio<br> Workout 2</p> <p> <strong> 2</strong> </p> <p> Rest</p> <p> Full body<br> Workout B</p> <p> Cardio<br> Workout 1</p> <p> Full body<br> Workout A</p> <p> Rest</p> <p> Full body<br> Workout B</p> <p> Cardio<br> Workout 2</p> <p> <strong> 3</strong> </p> <p> Rest</p> <p> Full body<br> Workout A</p> <p> Cardio<br> Workout 1</p> <p> Full body<br> Workout B</p> <p> Rest</p> <p> Full body<br> Workout A</p> <p> Cardio<br> Workout 2</p> <p> <strong> 4</strong> </p> <p> Rest</p> <p> Full body<br> Workout B</p> <p> Cardio<br> Workout 1</p> <p> Full body<br> Workout A</p> <p> Rest</p> <p> Full body<br> Workout B</p> <p> Cardio<br> Workout 2</p> <p> <strong> 5</strong> </p> <p> Rest</p> <p> Full body<br> Workout A</p> <p> Cardio<br> Workout 1</p> <p> Full body<br> Workout B</p> <p> Rest</p> <p> Full body<br> Workout A</p> <p> Cardio<br> Workout 2</p> <p> <strong> 6</strong> </p> <p> Rest</p> <p> Full body<br> Workout B</p> <p> Cardio<br> Workout 1</p> <p> Full body<br> Workout A</p> <p> Rest</p> <p> Full body<br> Workout B</p> <p> Cardio<br> Workout 2</p> <h4> What does “5 reps/L/R (10RM) for X-min” mean?</h4> <p> Set your timer for the number of minutes (X) recommended and choose a weight you can perform 10 repetitions with. In this workout, you’ll only be performing 5 reps. With 5 reps “left in the tank,” you’ll be able to move to the pair exercise with little to no rest. For the paired exercise, do the same: Do what the workout suggests rep-wise or choose a weight you can do 10 times, but only perform 5 reps. Go back and forth between these paired exercises with as little rest as possible. Once your timer beeps, you’re done that circuit for that workout. Make sure to check the table for the suggested timeframe for the following week(s).</p> <h3> <span> Flamingo Images / Shutterstock</span> </h3> <p> Edgar Artiga </p> <h3> Workout A: Full Body</h3> <span> <strong> Exercise Number</strong> </span> <span> <strong> Exercise</strong> </span> <span> <strong> Week 1 Sets/Reps</strong> </span> <span> <strong> Week 2 Sets/Reps</strong> </span> <span> <strong> Week 3 Sets/Reps</strong> </span> <span> <strong> Week 4 Sets/Reps</strong> </span> <span> <strong> Week 5 </strong> </span> <br> <span> <strong> Sets/Reps</strong> </span> <span> <strong> Week 6<br> Sets/Reps</strong> </span> A1 Barbell Front Squat 5 reps (10RM) for 6-min 5 reps (10RM) for 8-min 5 reps (10RM) for 10-min 5 reps (10RM) for 12-min 5 reps (10RM) for 14-min 5 reps (10RM) for 15-min A2 Pull Up 5 reps for 6-min 5 reps for 8-min 5 reps for 10-min 5 reps for 12-min 5 reps for 14-min 5 reps for 15-min B1 Romanian Deadlift 5 reps (10RM) for 6-min 5 reps (10RM) for 8-min 5 reps (10RM) for 10-min 5 reps (10RM) for 12-min 5 reps (10RM) for 14-min 5 reps (10RM) for 15-min B2 Single Arm Dumbbell Bench Press 5 reps/L/R (10RM) for 6-min 5 reps/L/R (10RM) for 8-min 5 reps/L/R (10RM) for 10-min 5 reps/L/R (10RM) for 12-min 5 reps/L/R <p> (10RM) for 14-min</p> 5 reps/L/R (10RM) for 15-min C Barbell Complex* 3×6/ <p> exercise</p> 3×8/ <p> exercise</p> 3×6/ <p> exercise**</p> 3×8/ <p> exercise**</p> 3×6/ <p> exercise***</p> 3×8/ <p> exercise***</p> D Dumbbell Pushups 100 as fast as possible 100 as fast as possible 100 as fast as possible 100 as fast as possible 100 as fast as possible 100 as fast as possible <p> *Barbell Complex = Bent Over Row, Hang Power Clean to Push Press, Back Squat<br> <span> **add 5-10lb to the weight used the week prior</span> <br> <span> ***add 5-10lb to the weight used the week prior</span> </p> <span> Hero Images / Getty</span> <p> Hero Images / Getty </p> <h3> Workout B: Full Body</h3> <span> <strong> Exercise Number</strong> </span> <span> <strong> Exercise</strong> </span> <span> <strong> Week 1 Sets/Reps</strong> </span> <span> <strong> Week 2 Sets/Reps</strong> </span> <span> <strong> Week 3 Sets/Reps</strong> </span> <span> <strong> Week 4 Sets/Reps</strong> </span> <span> <strong> Week 5<br> Sets/Reps</strong> </span> <span> <strong> Week 6<br> Sets/Reps</strong> </span> A1 Conventional Deadlift 5 reps (10RM) for 6-min 5 reps (10RM) for 8-min 5 reps (10RM) for 10-min 5 reps (10RM) for 12-min 5 reps (10RM) for 14-min 5 reps (10RM) for 15-min A2 Chest Supported Dumbbell Row 5 reps (10RM) for 6-min 5 reps (10RM) for 8-min 5 reps (10RM) for 10-min 5 reps (10RM) for 12-min 5 reps (10RM) for 14-min 5 reps (10RM) for 15-min B1 Bulgarian Split Squat 5 reps/L/R (10RM) for 6-min 5 reps/L/R (10RM) for 8-min 5 reps/L/R (10RM) for 10-min 5 reps/L/R (10RM) for 12-min 5 reps/L/R <p> (10RM) for 14-min</p> 5 reps/L/R (10RM) for 15-min B2 Single Arm Dumbbell Overhead Press 5 reps/L/R (10RM) for 6-min 5 reps/L/R (10RM) for 8-min 5 reps/L/R (10RM) for 10-min 5 reps/L/R (10RM) for 12-min 5 reps/L/R <p> (10RM) for 14-min</p> 5 reps/L/R (10RM) for 15-min C Barbell Complex* 3×6/ <p> exercise</p> 3×8/ <p> exercise</p> 3×6/ <p> exercise**</p> 3×8/ <p> exercise**</p> 3×6/ <p> exercise***</p> 3×8/ <p> exercise***</p> D Inverted Suspension Row 100 as fast as possible 100 as fast as possible 100 as fast as possible 100 as fast as possible 100 as fast as possible 100 as fast as possible <p> *Barbell Complex = Romanian Deadlift, Hang Clean to Thruster (squat to press), Good Morning<br> <span> **add 5-10lb to the weight used the week prior</span> <br> <span> ***add 5-10lb to the weight used the week prior</span> </p> <span> Per Bernal / M+F Magazine</span> <p> Per Bernal </p> <h3> Cardio Workout 1</h3> <p> Start with a 5-10 minute general cardiovascular warm up followed by 5-10 minute dynamic drills (stretches and skipping variations).</p> <p> Next, set up a treadmill to the maximal incline and at a speed you can sprint for 30-seconds.

Perform 30-sec Elbow Plank on the exercise ball. Perform another 30-sec hill sprint. Perform 30 reverse crunches while holding the dumbbell (which is placed on the floor above your head). Perform another 30-sec hill sprint. Perform 30 ab wheel rollouts from your knees. <p> Repeat this total sequence 8-10 times through.</p> <p> Finish with a 5-10 minute general cardiovascular cool down.</p> <h3> Cardio Workout 2</h3> <p> Start with a 5-10 minute general cardiovascular warm up followed by 5-10 minute dynamic drills (stretches and skipping variations).</p> <p> Next, set up a treadmill to the maximal incline and at a speed you can sprint for 60-seconds.</p> Perform a 60-sec hill sprint and carefully step off the treadmill (keep it running). Perform 20 kneeling high cable crunches. Perform a farmer’s carry with the heaviest dumbbells you can find. Walk as far as possible before putting the dumbbells down. Perform another 60-sec hill sprint. Perform 20 lateral medicine ball wall tosses per side. Perform another farmer’s carry just as written above. <p> Repeat this total sequence 6-8 times through.</p> <p> Finish with a 5-10 minute general cardiovascular cool down.</p> <p> Losing fat and taking your body fat percent down is not as easy task. You’re going to need a great support team to help you stay on track. Make sure to get enough quality sleep per night to ensure you can recovery well in between workouts – shoot for 7-9 hours per night. Drink plenty of water spaced throughout the day and prepare healthy snacks just incase you’re out and get hungry. Remember, diet plays more of a role in fat loss than high intensity workouts. I’ll end by rephrasing a quote I read from fitness great Adam Bornstein: “Eat for the body you want, not for the body you currently have.”</p> Healthy Eating <h3> 28-Days-to-Lean Meal Plan </h3> <p> With the right plan and the right discipline, you can get seriously shredded in just 28 days.</p> Read article <span> Topics:</span> Abs Belly Fat Build Muscle Burn Fat Cardio fat burning Fat Loss Fat-burning workouts Full Body Total-body workouts <span> Written by</span> <span> Jon-Erik Kawamoto </span> <span> Also by Jon-Erik Kawamoto </span> Workout Tips <h3> 10 Mobility Exercises to Do Before a Workout </h3> Workout Tips <h3> Here's Why Your Gains Have Stalled </h3> <h2> Stay up to date</h2> <p> Sign up below to receive our newest workout routines, recipes, news stories, and offers from our partners</p> <h3> Success!</h3> <p> Thank you for signing up.
